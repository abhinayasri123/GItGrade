# GitGrade – GitHub Repository Analyzer

GitGrade is a recruiter-style GitHub repository evaluation tool that analyzes public repositories and converts them into a **Repository Quality Score**, **Professional Maturity Level**, and a **personalized improvement roadmap**.

Unlike traditional repository analyzers that rely on surface-level metrics, GitGrade focuses on **real-world hiring signals** such as documentation quality, commit consistency, project structure, and engineering discipline.

The goal of GitGrade is to help developers understand **how their repositories are perceived by recruiters and mentors**, and what actionable steps they can take to improve their hiring readiness.
## ✨ Key Features
- Recruiter-style repository evaluation
- Repository Quality Score (0–100)
- Professional Maturity Level assessment
- Honest evaluation summary
- Actionable improvement roadmap
- Clean and intuitive Streamlit UI
## 🎯 Why GitGrade?
GitHub repositories are often judged within seconds during hiring reviews.
GitGrade mirrors this real-world evaluation process by focusing on clarity,
structure, and maintainability rather than inflated or misleading metrics.

This makes GitGrade especially useful for students and early-career developers
who want to improve their GitHub profiles for interviews and portfolio reviews.
